# Komodo Lang

Komodo is an open source mutlipurpose language meant to fix some things that other popular languages didn't do very well. Features will be inspired by many languages including:

- Javascript
- Python
- Porth
- C++

My plans for Komodo are to create an efficient language that can be either interpreted or compiled. It will have some of the following features:

- Support multiple paradigms such as OOP and functional programming
- Optional Semicolons
- Anonymous functions that make sense
- A powerful standard library
- Support for high level operations and abstractions, but also low level memory operations
- Self Hosted
- Static typing
- Optional type annotations
